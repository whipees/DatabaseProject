.. === <mysql> ====
MySQL Connector/Python enables Python programs to access MySQL databases, using
an API that is compliant with the `Python Database API Specification v2.0
(PEP 249) <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/>`_ - We refer to it as the
`Classic API <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-reference.html>`_.

.. === </mysql> ====

.. === <mysqlx> [repl("It also", "MySQL Connector/Python")] ===
It also contains an implementation of the `XDevAPI <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/x-devapi-userguide/en>`_
- An Application Programming Interface for working with the `MySQL Document Store
<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/document-store.html>`_.

Features

* `Asynchronous Connectivity <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-asyncio.html>`_
* `C-extension <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-cext.html>`_
* `Telemetry <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-opentelemetry.html>`_
* `XDevAPI <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/x-devapi-userguide/en>`_

Installation
------------

Connector/Python contains the classic and XDevAPI connector APIs, which are
installed separately. Any of these can be installed from a binary
or source distribution.

Binaries are distributed in the following package formats:

* `RPM <https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/packaging_and_distributing_software/introduction-to-rpm_packaging-and-distributing-software>`_
* `WHEEL <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/discussions/package-formats/#what-is-a-wheel>`_

On the other hand, the source code is distributed as a compressed file
from which a wheel package can be built.

The recommended way to install Connector/Python is via `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/>`_,
which relies on WHEEL packages. For such a reason, it is the installation procedure
that is going to be described moving forward.

Please, refer to the official MySQL documentation `Connector/Python Installation
<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-installation.html>`_ to
know more about installing from an RPM, or building and installing a WHEEL package from
a source distribution.

Before installing a package with `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/>`_, it is strongly suggested
to have the most recent ``pip`` version installed on your system.
If your system already has ``pip`` installed, you might need to update it. Or you can use
the `standalone pip installer <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installation/>`_.

The *classic API* can be installed via pip as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install mysql-connector-python

.. === </mysql> ====

.. === <mysqlx> [repl("similarly, the *XDevAPI* can be installed with:", "")] ===
similarly, the *XDevAPI* can be installed with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install mysqlx-connector-python

Please refer to the `installation tutorial <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/dev/connector-python/installation.html>`_
for installation alternatives of the XDevAPI.

Installation Options
++++++++++++++++++++

Connector packages included in MySQL Connector/Python allow you to install
optional dependencies to unleash certain functionalities.

.. === <mysql> ===
.. code-block:: bash

    # 3rd party packages to unleash the telemetry functionality are installed
    $ pip install mysql-connector-python[telemetry]

.. === </mysql> ===

.. === <mysqlx> [repl("similarly, for the XDevAPI:", "")] ===
similarly, for the XDevAPI:

.. code-block:: bash

    # 3rd party packages to unleash the compression functionality are installed
    $ pip install mysqlx-connector-python[compression]

.. === </mysqlx> ===

This installation option can be seen as a shortcut to install all the
dependencies needed by a particular feature. Mind that this is optional
and you are free to install the required dependencies by yourself.
